# gameEngineDemo
2D Physics-based game engine and demo written in c++. Using the Box2d Physics Engine. Using OpenGL for rendering. 

This is a purely personal project for experimenting with and learning C++ and game engine design, as such it is not well documented.

Includes a demo of a renderer that processes a field of view, and converts the rest of the screen to monochrome.
